# Advent of Code 2021

A repo containing my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles for 2021.   
All solutions are written in javascript and meant to be run with NodeJS.

## Running the programs
To run a puzzle solving program run either  
`node part1.js` or `node part2.js`  
from within the specific puzzle folder.

## Puzzle inputs
All of the *input.txt* files are populated with the inputs that I received for the puzzles.  
If you want to run these programs against your given input for a specific puzzle just change the contents of the *input.txt* file in the puzzles folder.
