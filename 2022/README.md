# Advent of Code 2022

A repo containing my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles for 2022.   
Went with Javascript last year so this year I am changing it up and going with Go.

## Running the programs
The puzzles are either solved together in one file which is then called `solutions.go` or each part in a separate file called `solution-1.go` or `solution-2` respectively.

To run a puzzle solving program run either  
`go run solutions.go` or `go run solution-{1-2}.go` (depending on if it was solved in one or separate files)
from within the specific puzzle folder.

## Puzzle inputs
All of the *input.txt* files are populated with the inputs that I received for the puzzles.  
If you want to run these programs against your given input for a specific puzzle just change the contents of the *input.txt* file in the puzzles folder.
